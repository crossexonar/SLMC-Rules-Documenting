Rules of Conduct:
These are rules that will govern everyone's behavior in the sim. If you break any of these you will be banned from the sim for an indefinite period of time.

1) Do not intentionally crash or destabilize the region, or its' residents. 
Nobody should ever have to worry about their hardware being potentially damaged or their viewer crashing while in our region. Likewise, we don't host the sim just to have it go down every time something gets heated. This rule also applies to threats. We don't negotiate with terrorists.

2) Do not copybot, or leak content.
If you are a copybotter, content thief, or leaker; don’t expect yourself to be welcome here

3) Be excellent to everyone.
Everyone who is willing to play nice is welcome at Cydonia. Therefore, each person in the sim should be treated with respect. If you're going to have petty arguments, please keep it in private.

5) No child avatars
Don't wear an avatar that makes you look under the age of 18.

6) Follow moderator instructions
The mods are the ultimate authority in the sim. Listen to their commands or you will find yourself on the curb fast.

Rules of Combat Engagement:

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:

-FUN FOR EVERYONE is paramount. If you are doing a type of combat just to specifically upset other people intentionally, rethink your actions, because pissing off everyone to the point where they won't want to fight here anymore will make us upset at you specifically for killing our traffic.

-Moderators have the right to tell you to stop doing something, no questions asked. In the nature of saving time, this list has been provided to get things and activities out of the way that we do not want to see on the sim full-stop. Things and behaviors NOT listed here are still subject to our approval or denial.

-You will be given a verbal warning if you are doing something we deem unacceptable and it's worth the time talking to you. If you persist you will be locked in the spawn or sent off sim until you listen. Generally speaking if you are getting auto-returned, ejected or whatnot, maybe you should rethink what you are doing. If you want to argue semantics with us and we are not in the mood to play lawyer, we will just curb you immediately.

-The Combat Zone should GENERALLY be kept teamless or "dog-pile free". We have no true way of strictly enforcing this and follow the honor system. Don't bring in 8 people and then all team up against a handful of lonewolves, that's not fun for anyone. Working together with groups of 2-4 people is perfectly fine. Please self enforce your groups so we don't have to.

-Vehicles are allowed and encouraged, however don't be ridiculous in which ones you decide to use. Using a 300HP MBT against a couple brand new lone wolves won't be fun for anyone.


THE ABSOLUTE BARE MINIMUM RULES:
-Don't wireframe, use hitboxes or anything that lets you see people through walls or concealment.
-Do not intentionally shoot through solid objects.
-Don't use bullshit that's globally not allowed (Autokillers, NPVs, etc.).
-Prejump and hardfall must always be enabled (Nimble OFF).
-No outlandish movement enhancers. If you have any doubts, ask a staff member.


1) General equipment rules

-Jetpacks/Jumppacks/Floatpacks and whatever else people want to call them ARE allowed, but subject to scrutiny if they go crazy. If you act like a plane, people will treat you like one. Only use a semi-automatic projectile weapon, or something similar and/or melee weapons when using a jetpack. Do not use raycast weapons or full-autos with a jetpack.

-Explosives and area of effect munitions must have a raycast check beyond 1 meter to avoid blowing up people through walls. Explosives should have a reasonable size depending on the platform they are fired from.

-Melee weapons should have a reasonable range and a raycast check. Please consider adding a cooldown to your melees. Do not have your melee weapons fling you around when you use them.

-Breaching isn't permitted.

-’Flak’ is only allowed to be used against aircraft, and anything we deem as aircraft. Flak can only be vehicle fired and not from any form of infantry weapon or auto-turret.

-Mines and remote explosives must be able to be destroyed from a single collision with a bullet.

-Anti tank munitions should have values proportional to their size, firepower, reload rate and firerate.


2) Vehicle and deployable rules
-LBA based health systems are the only ones permitted here. Legacy armor is not permitted.
--All items rezzed out must be able to be destroyed at anytime with LBA damage. Don't make your stuff inverse unless it is a breaching hole. 

-Deployable teleporters are not permitted.

-Don't deploy gigantic walls and/or shields. If we need help adding to the sim's design, we'll ask you. 
--To clarify, using a bunch of small deployables is fine, this rule is about those stupid huge T'koi/Coercion style bubbleshields, walls or bunkers with hundreds of HP.

-Munition interception deployables must have an ammo count.. They must have a raycast check. They may not reload while being active. Munition interceptors may never be avatar worn or follow an avatar. ‘Reflectors’ count under this rule. 
--!!Only one may be deployed per person!!
    
-Be considerate with landmine usage. Please try to limit 5 landmines per person.

-Automated turrets may not be used currently.

-Deployables that are obviously not man-portable are not to be instantly deployed and usable. Large deployables must be constructed and able to be interrupted before being usable.

-All vehicles and deployables need a solid hitbox that conforms to it's visual representation.

Normal LBA HP rules:
-Ground vehicles may not exceed 300HP
 Gunships may not exceed 100hp and speeds of 50m/s
 Jet aircraft may not be armored and may not exceed speeds of 150m/s
 No fleetships right now. Thanks.
