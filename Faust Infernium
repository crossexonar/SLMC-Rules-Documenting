S E C T I O N 1: I N T R O D U C T I O N

This notecard will go over rules in detail for the Faust Infernium sim, as well as our weapon tiers. There are not many rules that will result in a ban - this is a policy from older times that we are working to restore - but there are a few. They will be noted as such. While it would be preferred that no rule could do so, there are some that result in an unavoidable need for such a reaction - griefing severely enough to prevent removal via normal methods can result in this, for example. If you feel you have been unjustly banned, contact relevant high command within Faust in order to appeal. Few bans are not able to be appealed, but some may be enforced for a length of time.

Our primary enforcement method is Escalation. Usually, this is reciprocal - you pull out a Tier 2 set, we'll employ our Tier 2. However, punitive Escalation exists for rule-breakers, so please be aware of this before you begin to flaunt rules.

S E C T I O N 2: G E N E R A L  R U L E S

These rules govern the expected conduct of all participants.

1) Excessive intentional black-screening is not allowed by either side. Given both sides are provided a safe zone, this should be theoretically impossible, but don't try for the sake of trying.

2) Excessive flaming and generally bad behavior can be met with escalation including but not limited to: a serious amount of fucks not given, an estate kick and/or ban, or forfeiting of spawn protection.  

3) Maximum Combat Height for non-fleet is 1000m. Fleet is limited to 2500m, and you are not to go out of your way to target platforms - R&D and training - that might be above or at that height. 

4) Non-combative personnel must declare their status. Otherwise, assume you will be shot on sight once in the combat arena.

5) Follow all instructions given by region overseers. The heat is battle is not the time to debate regulations and any disputes will be discussed over combat operations cease.  Region overseers will either declare themselves or make themselves known upon request. Anyone who is a Ringleader, Viceroy, or Field Commander is permitted to fulfill this role.
    - NOTE: Telling region moderation to contact another person will be treated as non-compliance.

6) Don't forget to be human. We're here to have fun and shoot each other. If you're getting too invested into this and becoming angry, take a step back. If you feel a fight has turned nasty, contact the OIC and talk about ways to fix it. Both sides of a conflict should be having fun, and if one or both is not, something needs to be fixed.

7) Keep explicit behavior and conduct off the sim. 

All bans are 24 hours minimum.

S E C T I O N 3: I N F A N T R Y  R U L E S

1) Flash bangs must be reasonable. Don't include overtly loud noises or rapidly flashing colors and the like. Blinding effects may only last for 10 seconds and must be raycasted.

2) Infantry launched explosives may not exceed a 5 meter radius. Explosives without a raycast check are NOT allowed.

3) Proximity fuses (detonates in proximity to player) are not allowed for infantry weapons.

4) Automatic weapons that fire explosives should not exceed a radius of 2.5 meters, and may not have more than 1 rezzer. Equivalent RPM should be at or around 600RPM max. Explosion must deal reduced damage.

5) Seekers must comply with these guidelines: https://github.com/MalefactorIX/SLMC-Seeker-2020 . Minimum lock-on time is 2 seconds.

6) Infantry weapons may not exceed a fire-rate of 1200 RPM.

7) Ammunition per clip/magazine may not exceed 200 rounds, and reload times no less than 5 seconds for clips/magazines that exceed 100 rounds.

8) Bullet sizes may not exceed 5 meters in length and 0.05 meters in width. Tank shells or the equivalent is allowed to be up to 0.2m in width.

9) Movement enhancers (dodge rolls, dash, slides) are allowed, but may not exceed a 5 meter dash and may only occur on a 5 second cooldown. Mid-air dashing is only allowed with dedicated melee weapons.

10) Omnidirectional Jump packs and Jet packs are not allowed. We do allow a double jump (10s cooldown) or short-range boost packs with only vertical acceleration (10s cooldown after landing).

11) Enhances or features that disable pre-jump or landing animations are disallowed. Dashes are allowed to break the landing state.

12) AVflight is strictly prohibited. Use of AVflight will result in an orbital strike on the offending target.

13) Going into the opposing designated spawn area is prohibited.

14) Grapple hooks are allowed. Avatar velocity may not exceed 5m/s and range may not exceed 30m. 10s cooldown after disengaged.

15) Weapons, either intentionally or otherwise, that kill through physics/prims are not allowed.
    - ie. "Penetrator" rounds, or non-raycast explosives and melee attacks.

S E C T I O N 4: V E H I C L E  R U L E S

1) You may have a maximum of 2 air vehicles, and 2 ground vehicles per side.

2) All vehicles must be destructible by LBA. Tanks are permitted to ignore collision damage, or LBA damage that is 5 or less.

3) Ground armor may not exceed 250HP for tanks or mechs, and 30 HP for armored infantry units.

4) Aerial vehicles should have the following HP Values:
    - Light Craft (Fighters): Unarmored, or up to 25HP
    - Medium Craft (Gunships): Up to 100HP
    - Heavy Craft (Fleet): Up to 500HP

5) No absurdly excessive weaponry may be used in any vehicle - this is harder to quantify, so you will be informed if you need to tone things back. Much as we may enjoy the idea, nuking from orbit with a fleetship is not allowed. Uses infantry rules as a benchmark for compliance.

6) All health systems must have an open and public github page for references. You must be able to provide the sourcecode for your health system. Private systems will not be permitted.

S E C T I O N 5: M I S C.  R U L E S

1) There are no rules governing the declaration or prior announce of a raid, nor are their any regulations limiting the amount of personnel you may deploy to the field. However, the attacker:defender ratio is considered when it determining the appropriate weapon tiers and types that are being deployed.

2) A group may attack once per day. Raids which persist for an excess amount of time may be terminated by the defending OIC. You can request for additional raid opportunities after your first for that day if desired.

3) Assume things not mentioned in this ruleset are disallowed unless otherwise advised by region moderation. Even if something is disallowed, we may make a temporary exception if requested.

4) Spawn zones are clearly marked. Do not enter the opposing spawn zones.

S E C T I O N 6: B A N N E D  E Q U I P M E N T

S E C T I O N 7: H I T S C A N  W E A P O N S / A G E N T L I S T

All closed-source, agentlist-based raycast weapons will be disallowed. This includes equipment which functions in a similar principle (widecast).
They must follow all regulations which govern raycast weapons and will be subject to higher scrutiny.

[Guidelines]
Raycast weapons are allowed, but must suffer from some form of inaccuracy or damage reduction with range and/or movement.
    - Weapons firing in excess of 400 RPM must deal partial damage and cannot be lethal on a single-shot level.
    - Weapons firing in excess of 600 RPM will not be permitted.
Raycast weapons will also have the open-source review requirement in cases where it is suspected of non-compliance or the distributor cannot be trusted to provide credible testimony of its function
Note: Hybrid Raycast rounds also must be compliant with these regulations in order to be permitted.

[If you fail compliance]
If you believe your weapon(s) to be compliance, they can be approved by region moderation after review. Otherwise, use of an unsanctioned weapon will be treated as a T3 deployment of armaments. In extreme cases, it will be treated as a T4 deployment which is an immediate combat ban. If your weapon is considered non-compliant, you can request a view of the affected equipment and this section will be updated accordingly.

[COMPLIANT]
- Most DPS/DMS Weapons - Meets the open-source requirement and all stats are published directly from the source code. Generally compliant with balance expectations.

[NON-COMPLIANT]
- All ESC raycast Rounds - Damage/Accuracy vs ROF. and/or Tracer visibility is non-compliant
- All SH raycast weapons - Agentlist, excess damage for ROF, tracer visibility is non-compliant, and/or does not adhere to line-of-sight.

S E C T I O N 8: E S C A L A T I O N

Escalation is broken down into 4 tiers
Tier 1: Basic Equipment
    - Rifles, Hand Grenades, Etc
Tier 2: Advanced Technology
    - Vehicles, Artillery, Rockets, MGLs, Etc
Tier 3: War Crimes
    - Fleet, Nukes/Heavy Artillery, Bussian Rias, Etc

Escalation beyond T3 is an estate ban.
